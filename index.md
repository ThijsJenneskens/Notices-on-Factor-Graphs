title: Notices on Factor Graphs
---

Welcome to **Notices on Factor Graphs** — an online colloquium and lightweight hub for people who share an interest in the factor-graph perspective across application areas.

Our goals are modest and practical:

- Provide a single place to discover **upcoming talks/meetings**.
- Curate **materials**: foundational papers, tutorials, software, and drawing templates.
- Offer simple **contact** info to foster collaboration and announcements.

**What are factor graphs?**  
Factor graphs are bipartite graphical models that make the factorization structure of functions explicit, enabling clear reasoning about inference, optimization, and message passing in diverse domains.
